1|Rasberry Pi Camera long cable| Although the Camera comes with a short cable, a long cable makes life much easier. Most Raspberry Pi suppliers should stock longer cables e.g. [Little Bird Electronics - Flex Cable for Raspberry Pi Camera - 18 / 457mm](https://littlebirdelectronics.com.au/collections/raspberry-pi-cables-headers/products/flex-cable-for-raspberry-pi-camera-18-457mm)

## Instructions

The 3D printed clamp housing consists of four parts:

* Camera mount
* Lens housing
* LED housing
* Spacer

![](./images/3d-printed-parts-desc.jpg)

1.  Solder 100mm lengths of 25 AWG red and black wires to the positive and negative terminals of one side of each 50mm light strip. Put two of the LED strips aside for later (to be used for the illumination foot)

2.  For each LED strip section feed the wires through the hole, remove the adhesive backing label and stick the LED strip section in place.

3. Mount the camera using the four 8mm screws and nuts. Insert the screws from underneath to ensure there is enough clearance between the screws and the macro lens.

4. Insert four 3mm nuts into the four nut recesses in the LED housing

5. Insert the Moment macro lens into the lens recess in the LED housing

6. Hold the LED wires in place in the LED wires channel and add the lens housing ensuring that the two parts are joined flush.

7. Add the camera mount to the top. The camera lens sits slightly proud of the mount and should slot into the opening of the macro lens. Take special care to ensure the two are aligned. Turn the assembly over and look through the macro lens to check that the camera and lens are aligned. 

    Depending on the quality and accuracy of the 3D printer you may need to adjust one or more of the holes that mount the camera until the lens and camera are correctly aligned. A dissecting microscope can be helpful in ensuring alignment.

8. Screw the assembly together using the four 3mm x ~35mm bolts which will screw into the nuts inset in the LED housing. This should be done slowly and carefully to ensure that the camera is not forced into the top of the lens.

9. Attach the four 5mm x ~75mm bolts to the spacer through the underside and fix with four 5mm nuts on the top.

10. Screw on four additional 5mm nuts to be used as spacers.

11. Insert spacer into the main assembly.

    ![](./images/IMG_5981.jpg)

12. Attach with a single 5mm nut.

    ![](./images/IMG_5982.jpg)

13. Paint the inside of the illumination foot and attach the two remaining LED strips to two of the faces and feed the wires through the holes. Note the image shows the light foot printed with a transparent plastic. Transparent material is not required. The most important thing is that the light well is painted with a reflective material such as white paint (acrylic-based works well).

14. Insert the four 5mm x ~80mm bolts through the underside of the illumination foot.

    ![](./images/IMG_5987.jpg)

15. Drill four holes in the diffuser, insert over the bolts and fix with four 5mm nuts. Tip: to mark where to drill the holes in the diffuser, align and hold the diffuser against the 3D printed foot then put it up against a light so you can see the holes shine through the diffuser plastic. Mark the centre of each hole with a marker then remove the diffuser, place on a flat piece of scrap wood and carefully drill through the diffuser into the wood. Gently is the key - acrylic sheets when drilled can easily shatter and crack.

16. Insert light box into main assembly.
